Basic NFS configuration Ubuntu 20.04

Server
apt update && apt upgrade && apt install nfs-kernel-server

mkdir /var/homes

nano /etc/exports (this page is going to be edited so we can indicate which page to export,in this case is /var/homes)

# /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported
#               to NFS clients.  See exports(5).
#
# Example for NFSv2 and NFSv3:
# /srv/homes       hostname1(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) hostname2(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
# Example for NFSv4:
# /srv/nfs4        gss/krb5i(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt,no_subtree_check)
# /srv/nfs4/homes  gss/krb5i(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
/var/homes *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash) -> add this in the end of this file

exportfs -a  -> this command is used to export the files indicated in /etc/exports (the command done before)

systemctl restart --now nfs-kernel-server

adduser   _______ --home /var/homes/_______  -> (ex: adduser azores --home /var/homes/azores)
echo xfce4-session > /var/homes/_______/.xsession -> (ex: echo xfce4-session > /var/homes/azores/.xsession)
chown ______:______ /var/homes/________/.xsession -> (chown azores:azores /var/homes/azores/.xsession)

Client
apt update && apt upgrade && apt install nfs-common

mkdir /var/homes

mount -t nfs serverIP:/var/homes /var/homes -> this command is used to connect to server through the path done in /etc/exports)

cat /etc/mtab -> copy the last line and paste it AND ADD " ,nofail" in the end of the line!! on /etc/fstab so it saves the configurations done by the last command so it is not need to do it everytime the machine is rebooted

to check if its working on CLiente do cd /var/homes and if the file with the user name is there its the confirmation that is working.
